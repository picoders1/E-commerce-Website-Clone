# What is about in this project

I have developed an eCommerce website using by HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP &amp; JAVASCRIPT. First of all, we have our landing page with banner section, some featured categories images, then some featured products with product price, image and rating. Then, there will be more latest products, and one offer section with exclusive product. After that there will be testimonials and top brands section. At the bottom of website we will make footer with 4 columns.  
After that I have put a drop down menu on top right side corner for mobile screen and I have made this complete website design responsive for any such small screen devices. Then we have other pages like all products page, single product page, shopping cart page, login and registration page, Contact &amp; About us page.

# What html and css is about
## HTML and CSS Basics
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the building blocks of the web. Here’s a concise overview of each:

HTML
Defines the structure and content of a web page
Uses tags (<> and </>) to wrap around content
Tags come in two forms: opening tags (e.g., <p>) and closing tags (e.g., </p>)
HTML provides basic structure, including:
Headings (h1-h6)
Paragraphs (p)
Lists (ul, ol, li)
Links (a)
Images (img)
Tables (table, tr, td)
Forms (form, input, textarea, select)
CSS
Defines the visual styling and layout of a web page
Uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply styles
Properties specify the style values (e.g., color, font-size, padding)
CSS is “cascading” because styles applied to parent elements can inherit to child elements
CSS can control:
Colors and backgrounds
Fonts and typography
Spacing and margins
Positioning and layout
Responsive design for different devices and screen sizes
Key Concepts
Semantic HTML: Using HTML tags that provide meaning to the structure of the page, rather than just presenting visual layout.
CSS selectors: Using syntax to target specific HTML elements and apply styles (e.g., .header, #logo, h1).
Cascading: Styles applied to parent elements can inherit to child elements, allowing for efficient and flexible styling.
Box model: CSS boxes (content, padding, border, margin) that define the layout and spacing of elements.
Best Practices
Use semantic HTML to provide structure and meaning to your content.
Keep CSS organized and modular using classes, IDs, and media queries.
Use a preprocessor like Sass or Less to write more efficient and reusable CSS.
Test and validate your HTML and CSS code using tools like the W3C HTML and CSS validators.
